<h3>Intructions</h3>
1.Extract the zip file<br/>
2.Make sure you have node.js installed, if not you can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/<br/>
3.Navigate in the folders, and go to server.js, then press F8 to run the server<br/>
4.In the browser, search for localhost:8765<br/>
5.Some item in the inventory should already show up. From this page, you can modify and delete different items in the inventory.<br/>
6.Click on the link, and it will bring you to another page where you can add items to the inventory.


The extra challenge I chose was to be able to filter by different things. <br/>
Here, my filter contains the option to check all Items, check items that are out of stock, and check items that are in stock.
