<h3>Intructions</h3>
1.Extract the zip file
2.Make sure you have node.js installed, if not you can download it here: [https://nodejs.org/en/]
3.Navigate in the folders, and go to server.js, then press F8 to run the server
4.In the browser, search for localhost:8765
5.Some item in the inventory should already show up. From this page, you can modify and delete different items in the inventory.
6.Click on the link, and it will bring you to another page where you can add items to the inventory.


The extra challenge I chose was to be able to filter by different things. <br/>
Here, my filter contains the option to check all Items, check items that are out of stock, and check items that are in stock.
